let me write next steps 

loans list filter default status should be active  

option to delete created loans 

foreclousore icon, change that to name rather tha icon 

payment progress bar  should be based on money collected rather than weeks paid 

when i click edit or pay now button in loans tab the pop up one should be silimr to the one on collections tab where it comes from above footer on mobile  and also make it more mobile friendly 

loan distribution date to first installlamnet is from sunday to saturday if given the date of first installamnt should be just next sunday i mean the adjusent one and also provide a way to edit that aswell

create new loan UI for mobile is not mobile friendly 

In loans tab remove the total outstanding amount and total principal ones  and add in analytics tab 

overdue payments in analytics should give loan and borowwers and number of weeks overdue, rather than everyweek list 


====
 there were doller symbols in few areas change that to rupees symbols everywhere
 Foreclose on loans tab is not changed  
 on mobile why add borower and crete loan on top when i have the bottom one

Foreclosure in loans tab is not having the date of foreclosure 

Import functionality not created


================

Foreclosed means closed loans why they were still showing in weekly collection of new week, 
Foreclose loan should close all the weeks pending with current date or the date set on foreclorese tab that should be added to the collected, it should rather give when click on foreclose give pending amonut and close all weeks 

delete loan confirmation UI is nothere 
add borrowers in top in mobile is not nesseary as we have in bottom 
overdue should give overview of number of weeks unpaid and when clicked or droped dow then should give weeks list 


On clicking the paynow on loan details it pops up the record payment page but on mobile it was not nice it should pop up from bottom i dont need to scroll up to fill up that and also the same goes for on collections pay it pops up from bottom but the upage and cancel were behind the footer icons

change the name of overdue to pending on collet tab and also i said for each individual loan on the pending/which was overdue it should dropdown the detals rather than the top one  

change the name of overdue to pending on collet tab and also i said for each individual loan on the pending/which was overdue it should dropdown the detals rather than the top one  , record tab on collections was nice create the same like one i mean the coming from bottom one on loans tab aswell for mobile
